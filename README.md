# Breast cancer prediction system

## Overview

- The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
- The notebook focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques.
- The dataset used for training and testing the model is included within the repository.
- The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, are implemented and compared for breast cancer prediction.
- Feature selection techniques and data visualization methods are applied to gain insights into the dataset.
- The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The notebook includes detailed explanations and comments to enhance understanding and facilitate learning.
